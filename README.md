## Installation:

- clone this repository to local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/epuer18/ReFill
```

- First we need to install and build at the project folder

```
npm install

npm run build
```

- To run the app, go the project folder, run:

```
npm run start

```

- make sure to add a .env file to the directory and make a `MONGO_URL` variable with the `uri` to connect to the right MongoDB Atlas database.

  - This site was developed with a database in MongoDB Atlas, to use the same database contact the authors with your IP number so that it can be added onto the permissions. Similarly, to prevent others from overusing these resources, we share a private key at our discression.
  - Otherwise you can create your own MongoDB Atlas project with a database named `ReFill` and two collections: `users` and `stations`.

```
MONGO_URL = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password><info_database_cluster>"
```
